	// its death carry the runner away (the engine's onExit → runner.Exit →
	// the live row disappears), because the PTY is the sole authority on liveness
	// and asserting an Exit we have not observed would make us a second one.
	//
	// Graceful matters twice over: a well-behaved CLI flushes its native transcript
	// on SIGTERM, so neither the provider being switched out nor the runner being
	// EVICTED from a conversation loses its last turn — and an evicted runner's
	// conversation is about to be read by the runner taking it over. Applies
	// uniformly to every provider (Codex tolerates it too); no provider branching.

	// boot reconciliation asks, Exiting every runner whose PTY did not survive the
	// restart. A false here means the CLI is definitively gone, even though no event
	// ever recorded it.
	//
	// It is deliberately NOT the engine's SessionExists, which is also true for a
	// PTY-less suspended placeholder — a session whose process is already dead and
	// whose only remaining substance is scrollback on disk. Asking the registry "do
	// you know this id?" instead of "is this process alive?" is what previously let a
	// restart-orphaned chat keep advertising a live agent.
